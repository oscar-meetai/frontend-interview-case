# INTERVIEW CASE FOR FRONTEND POSITION
Interview case for frontend developers to join Fika - Dating &amp; Make Friends.

# Project Case
You are in university and meet the rich international student who wants to display the information of all his favourite Star Wars characters on a website using a table structure. He is more of a backend person and has made an API to connect to his Star Wars JSON database. Because you're a smart guy and he recognizes your skills, he approaches you to work for him. His requirements are quite easy, but he is very demanding. He wants the website done **1 day** after he gives you the requirements. Luckily you are smart and will use some open source libraries to earn this easy money.

# Requirements
Use https://ant.design/ to find your table UI and implement it using Redux, Redux-Thunk. The API is found here: https://swapi.dev/ and you should display all the /people in the database on a table. If some fields are missing for some people, please handle that in a nice way.

You **MUST** write your code on a github repo that you later can send in to show all your commits.

# Evaluation
We will evaluate your performance on the structure of your code, the UI implementation as well as the final results.

# Deadline

**1 day** after you receive this assignment. Exactly 24 hours later. **Please send in your github project to oscar@keepfika.com**. Good luck!
